The single responsibility principle is to do one thing and do it well. With this in mind CSS should be split down to components, macro-layout and theming.</p>\n<p>CSS components should like Lego bricks to allow them to be reused in a range of different scenarios.</p>\n<p>Ben’s recommended approach is for the code to be additive, to start simple and build in complexity. He advocated a mobile-first approach.</p>\n<p>Build bottom up: start with base styles, components and then pages. Brad Frost’s Atomic Design cited as a good example.</p>\n<p>The mobile first approach can be problematic with old versions of IE which do not recognise media queries and serve up a mobile site instead. Javascript should not be used to fix the problem due to performance issues and lack of fallback. Instead a pre-processor can be used to serve media queries to all browsers except old IE versions and a different style sheet can be served up to IE.</p>\n<h2>Resources:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://Reload.me.uk/talk-structuring-css\">Talk Slides</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://GitHub.com/bpscott/breakup\">Conditional media query includes in Sass</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/\">Brad Frost: Atomic Web Design</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"FEL One Day - Structuring CSS","date":"01 October 2013","description":"FEL conference notes for Structuring CSS"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/fel-one-day-structuring-css/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/reasons-to-be-creative-2013/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Reasons to be creative 2013"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/handheld-conference/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Handheld Conference"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","3257411868"]}
