One gripe I have had with OSX is that it seemed unnecessarily difficult to view hidden files. Luckily I found Ian Lunn's article: [Quickly Show/Hide Hidden Files on Mac OS X Mavericks](http://ianlunn.co.uk/articles/quickly-showhide-hidden-files-mac-os-x-mavericks/)

It is worth spending a minute setting up a terminal alias. Now showing or hiding files is as simple as entering 'showFiles' or 'hideFiles' in the terminal.
